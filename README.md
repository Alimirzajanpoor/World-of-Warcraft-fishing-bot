this api works with your mic input i know its sound little a bit clunky at first but it works.
to adjust min freq and max you need to adjust the variable "freq_min" and "freq_max" in the code.
and you need to download the addon "Fishing Mode" to set the desired key_binds when you installed the addon set 1 keybind to fish and 2 to interact.


and when you go in game u have to change some sound settings when you went to sound setting turn off every sound execpt "Effect"
and turn on auto loot 
*optional* you can download "Fasterloot" addon if your character isnt looting quick

happy fishing
